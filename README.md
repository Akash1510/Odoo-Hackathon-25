# 🤝 SkillSwap – A Skill Exchange Platform

## 🚀 Overview

**SkillSwap** is a mini MERN-stack application designed to help individuals **exchange skills** by connecting users who want to learn new skills with others who can teach them.

Whether you want to learn Photoshop, practice yoga, or master public speaking – SkillSwap helps users **list the skills they offer**, **search for others by skill**, and **request a swap** to mutually benefit from shared knowledge.
